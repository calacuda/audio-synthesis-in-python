# audio-synthesis-in-python
audioSynth.py is a module that alows the user to produce numpy arrays that
can be set to the speakers as sound by modules like "simpleaudio" or
"sounddevices".


### Requirements:

python3 (3.6 or higher)
numpy
scipy
simpleaudio
pygame


### Mapping:

 w e   t y u   o p 
a s d f g h j k l ;

its just like a piano with teh note "C" being mapped to the keyboard key "a".
if you hold down the shift key (or use the caps lock key) you can get notes
that are an octave lower.
